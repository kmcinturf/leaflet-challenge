In this homework I have to map earthquakes.  

## Set Up

The data set I choose is significant earthquakes from the last 30 days. (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
I used JSON data from the United States Geological Survey.
This homework utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** These are the main files to run the analysis.



## Project Report

I was surprised to learn how active/ common earthquakes really are. The map shows that all active sights within the last 30 days. 

### **Important things to note:**
Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
